<h1 align="center">ðŸ§¬Two Layer Neural NetworkðŸ§¬</h1>
<h2 align="center">Simple neural network created for solving non-linear classification problem.</h2>

<h3 align="center">Network was build using only NumPy arrays.</h3>
<h3 align="center">In the project I was gradually implementing impovements to the network and compared results of the learning process.</h3>
<h3 align="center">I created a 20-page report based on this project, where I thoroughly described equations, methods, algorithms and interpreted networks' results.</h3>
<h3 align="center"> An instance of the results of learning process</h3>
