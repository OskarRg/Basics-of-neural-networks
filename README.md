<h2 align="center">ðŸ§¬Two Layer Neural NetworkðŸ§¬</h2>
<h3 align="center">A simple neural network created to solve non-linear classification problem.</h3>

<h4 >The network was built using only NumPy arrays.</h4>
<h4 >In the project, I was gradually implementing improvements to the network and comparing the results of the learning process.</h4>
<h4 >I created a 20-page report based on this project, where I thoroughly described equations, methods, algorithms and interpreted networks' results.</h4>
<h4 > An instance of the results of the learning process</h4>

<h2 align="center" >Project II</h2>
<h2 align="center" >ðŸ§¬Deep Neural NetworkðŸ§¬</h2>
<h3 align="center">A simple project of CNN created to solve the multiclass classification problem.</h3>
<h4 >The network was built using TensorFlow and Keras.</h4>
<h4 >In the project, I was gradually implementing improvements to the network and comparing the results of the learning process in order to find a satisfying solution.</h4>
<h4 >In the report based on this project, I compared models and analyzed the results using precision, recall and F1-score benchmarks.</h4>
